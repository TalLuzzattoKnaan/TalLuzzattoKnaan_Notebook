Dr. Tal Luzzatto Knaan is the head of the Functional Metabolomics lab. She earned her PhD in Biochemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As a Vaadia-BARD postdoctoral fellow, she joined the lab of Prof. Pieter C. Dorrestein at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmacological Sciences at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Her research focused on developing metabolomics-based approach to study microbial chemical communication, and exploring the marine chemical diversity for potential drug discovery. She did her second fellowship with Dr. Daniel Sher at the department of Marine Biology at the University of Haifa, studying the chemical interactions of marine picoplankton. In 2019, she started her own lab combining cutting-edge, multidisciplinary approach to explore the biological role, regulation, diversity and distribution of natural products in microbes and algae, and their potential biotechnological and medicinal applications. Tal is the head of the emerging Interdisciplinary Center for Metabolomics and Natural Products at the University of Haifa and active in Women in STEMM Leadership initiatives.
